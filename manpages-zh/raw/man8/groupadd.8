.TH GROUPADD 8
.SH NAME
groupadd \- Create a new group
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgroupadd\fR [\fB-g\fI gid \fR[\fB-o\fR]] [\fB-r\fR] [\fB-f\fR] \fIgroup\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgroupadd\fR command
creates a new group account using the values specified on the
command line and the default values from the system.
The new group will be entered into the system files as needed.
The options which apply to the \fBgroupadd\fR command are
.IP "\fB-g \fIgid\fR"
The numerical value of the group's ID.
This value must be unique, unless the \fB-o\fR option is used.
The value must be non-negative.
The default is to use the smallest ID value greater than 500 and
greater than every other group.
Values between 0 and 499 are typically reserved for \fIsystem accounts\fR.
.IP \fB-r\fR
This flag instructs \fBgroupadd\fR to add a \fIsystem
account\fR.  The first available \fIgid\fR lower than 499 will be
automatically selected unless the \fB-g\fR option is also given on the
command line.
.br
This is an option added by Red Hat.
.IP \fB-f\fR
This is the \fIforce\fR flag. This will cause \fBgroupadd\fR to exit with an
error when the group about to be added already exists on the
system. If that is the case, the group won't be altered (or added
again).
.br
This option also modifies the way \fB-g\fR option works. When you
request a \fIgid\fR that it is not unique and you don't specify the \fB-o\fR
option too, the group creation will fall back to the standard behavior
(adding a group as if neither \fB-g\fR or \fB-o\fR options were
specified).
.br
This is an option added by Red Hat.
